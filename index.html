                        Hi! My name is Ariana and I'm an aspiring full stack web developer. I've had an interest in tech ever since I first learned how to use a computer in the 3rd grade. However, I only recently decided to pursure it as a career because I realized I love learning and solving problems.
                        <br><br>
                        I find that I'm most passionate about the frontend, in particular building user interfaces. Aside from tech, art is another thing that I'm passionate about. I love learning about different artists, art forms, and I love creating it. This is why I love building websites, it gives me the best of both worlds. I get to design websites and build them using code. I love looking at various designs on dribbble or just anything that looks cool out there on the internet and recreating the design using my current knowledge on HTML and (S)CSS.
                        <br><br>
                        When I'm not coding I'm probably drawing on either my sketchbook or my iPad since I've recently gained an interest in creating digital art. And I do love long walks and hiking (however I haven't been able to go out as much I'd like because of quarantine). I also like reading, the current book that I'm reading is Dan Roam's <em>The Back of the Napkin</em>. I chose this book because it provides people with another way of thinking, visual thinking, in order to solve problems and express your ideas. You don't need to be the best artist in order to draw some lines and basic shapes, like squares or circles.

                        Kanvas is a professional social networking site aimed at software engineers, specifically entry-level developers, where users can create profiles to connect with each other and find jobs. It was built using the MERN stack and I took up the frontend developer role for this project.

                        The shell is a command line interpreter that was designed to mimic the UNIX shell and can execute basic commands such as ls and pwd. It was built with memory management in mind so there are no memory leaks and it was written entirely in the C programming language.
